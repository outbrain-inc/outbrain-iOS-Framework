# Read More Module - Implementation Guide

This module will expose the SmartFeed "above the scroll" on the article screen by collapsing some of the article (the part below the scroll).

The idea is to hide part of the article content and expose the Smartfeed to the user as early as possible.

## How it works?

We want to expose the Smartfeed to the user as early as possible, in order to do it the SDK will collapse some of the article items and add a "Read More" button at the end of those collaped items. This way the Smartfeed will be visible to the user before she reaches the end of the article.

When the user presses on the "Read More" button, the collapsed items will expand smoothly to their original height.

See example of how this module works below:
